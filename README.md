# Workday Scheduler

This is a simple application to plan your workday.

The current date is displayed at the top.

Each hour 9AM - 5PM is displayed in color corresponding to the past(gray), current(red), or future(green) time.

Text entered in the text area of each hour block is saved to local storage when the blue save button next to that block is clicked.

The schedule will render with each hour containing the text that was saved most recently.
